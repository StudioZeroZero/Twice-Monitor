# Twice-Monitor
A dedicated, low-profile ambient display system designed for seamless high-quality media integration.

AKA a device to automatically play my favorite variety show (Time To TWICE) in the background :D

**Key Features:**

- Versatile Mounting: Designed with a lightweight footprint (approx. [Insert Weight]g) optimized for non-destructive Command-strip wall mounting, balancing shear force requirements with thermal performance.

- Accessible Design: Optimized software to run perfectly on affordable, low-power hardware. Capability of smooth 1080p video playback and fast website loading without needing to buy a high-end display or a pricey Raspberry Pi 4.

- Universal Media Compatibility: Utilizing a custom Python/Bash backend to handle autoplay protocols for HTML5 video, YouTube, and dynamic web dashboards.
